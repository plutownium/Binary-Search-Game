# Binary-Search-Game
A repository for my first C++ app, a binary search style game.

Around an hour and a half ago I had the idea for a simple game coded in C++.

Coding the game would involve practicing with a while loop and some conditional logic. So as a newcomer to C++, I was into the idea.

Two hours or so later, here's the game on my GitHub.

To install the game, you need to either download the executable and run it, or download the .cpp file and run it through a C++ compiler.

Or you can follow the link to play a visualized version of my game: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/intro-to-algorithms/a/a-guessing-game
